### Background and Motivation
Indirect memory accesses arise in many emerging and important domains, including sparse deep learning, graph analytics, database processing and scientific computing.
They became a bottleneck in the performance of modern computer systems because the indirect patterns are hard to predict and prefetch. Those indirect memory accesses will cause a large number of cache misses and memory stalls, which will significantly degrade the performance of the system.
We have categorized related papers into two categories: Software-based and Hardware-based solutions.

### Comments on Prefetch-based Solutions
Cons1: Redundant memory accesses and similar computations to the cores

Cons2: If cannot prefetch correctly, will pollute the cache
